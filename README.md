# Chicago Car Crash Safety Analysis

Predicting level of injury based on features of the reported accident

## **Introduction**


![](./images//media/image1.jpeg)


Our client, an automobile manufacturer, is interested in increasing the safety rating of their upcoming line of new vehicles. They are considering the installation of a device that can detect when a crash has occured and predict whether or not EMS should be called to the scene automatically. The benefits of such a device are two-fold: A decrease in emergency response time, and an increase in customer confidence in the safety of their vehicles. We have been asked to prove this device is plausible using machine learning. Our task is to build a model capable of these predictions using data from the city of Chicago electronic crash reporting system. 


## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

We limited our analysis to features of this dataset that could theoretically be known by the proposed sensor device. Primary examples include weather and road conditions, time of day, vehicle type, contact point, and seatbelt use. The final dataset consists of over 600,000 unique accidents from 2017 to present day. 


The original target variable was split into many subclasses of injury, ranging from no injury at all to fatal. We binned this column into a binary classificationg problem: Accidents where an incapacitating or fatal injury occured and accidents with no serious reported injury. This way, the model either predicts an ambulance is necessary or not, which aligns with the initial busness goal. The final distribution of our target is shown in *Figure 1*:

Because of the large imbalance in our target class, it was necessary to implement balanced class weight parameters during our modeling steps. 

## **Performance Metrics**

In order to judge the performance of our model, we decided on two metrics:

### **Recall**

Our first performance metric is recall- a measure of our model's true positive rate. We would like our recall to be high, to maximize the probability that if someone is seriously injured in a crash, the model predicts this correctly and flags them for a potential EMS response.

### **False Positive Rate**

Our second performance metric is false positive rate (FPR)- a measure of how often our model misclassifies people as seriously injured when their injuries are non-incapacitating or there are no injuries at all. We want to minimize our FPR so that we avoid sending an ambulance to every minor fender bender in chicago.




## **Baseline Model**

In order to emulate the status quo we implemented a dummy classifier which defaulted to always predicting the majority class- no injury. This model's confusion matrix is shown in *Figure 2:*

This model is clearly ineffective- both the recall and FPR are zero, akin to having no device in the car at all. However, it will serve as a useful measuring stick to judge the improvements of our final model. 

## **Model Selection**

We fit our data to many different models in order to find the most effective solution. *Figure 3* below shows a table of the performance metrics of various models after tuning the relevant hyperparameters:

All except the baseline model preformed exceptionally well, and due to the virtual tie between random forest and XGBoost, we used the average fit time benchmark to decide on XGBoost as our final choice. 

## **Final Model**

*Figure 4* shows the confusion matrix for our final XGBoost model's performance on our test data set:

### **Final Recall Score**

As you can see, our model only misclassified 1 single person as having no serious injury. This is a recall of 99.9%, meaning a device using this model would be able to automatically dispatch an ambulance for almost everyone who needs one. 

### **Final FPR**

Out of 115,558 people in the test set who were not seriously injured in their accidents, our model misclassified 21.5%. This means around 1 in 5 people who's injuries are not incapacitating will be flagged for potential EMS response. However, we believe this is an acceptable number and our proposed solution in the recommendation section addresses this concern directly. 


## **Conclusions & Recommendations**

We find that XGBoost provides the optimal balance between recall and false positive rate. This model also proves that the proposed device would indeed have the neccessary predictive power to warrant it's use in our client's new vehicle line. We recommend moving into the prototyping phase with the added caveat of a secondary alert feature to address any potential false positives. This would likely be a notification that appears on the vehicle's display after detecting an accident which asks if any occupants are seriously injured. To decline an automatic EMS response a customer can simply press the cancel button, but if no response is recieved in a certain predetermined time, an ambulance will be dispatched immediately. With these recommendations, we believe that our client will be able to fully satisfy their original business problem of increasing the safety rating of their new line of vehicles.
